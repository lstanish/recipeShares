# recipeShares
A place to share/modify recipes

Rules of the road: 
1. Ratings: 1=sucks, 4=best ever. Add your inits to the rating so we get a feel for your food prefs.
2. Suggestions/edits: PLEASE do not change the original recipe. Instead, add your comments and suggestions below the recipe.
If there are particular sections that you want to suggest be changed, add an asterisk and then add the comment at the bottom.
3. Share with anyone and everyone! The more the merrier.
