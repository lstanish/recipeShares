It came with a pastry blender!

Ingredients:
2 cups flour
2/3 cups Crisco
1/4 tsp salt

1. Sift 2 cups of flourwith 1/4 tsp salt. Add ~1/3 cup Crisco, mix with pastry blender or 
fork to a fine-grained texture.

2. Add ~1/3 cup more Crisco with pastry blender to a coarser texture. Add ~5 tbsp very cold
water, mix with pastry blender.

3. Mold into 2 balls, roll out on a floured sheet of wax paper or aluminum foil with a 
floured rolling pin. Flip pie crust into pie pan, add pie filling, then prepare top crust
as above. Bake 350Degrees for ~1 hr or as filling requires.
